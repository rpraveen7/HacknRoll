# HackRoll Sleep Detector

## 🚀 The Only Files You Need to Edit

1.  **`app/page.tsx`**
    *   **What it is:** The main website page.
    *   **Edit this to:** Change the text, title, or layout of the page.

2.  **`components/SleepDetector.tsx`**
    *   **What it is:** The "brain" of the app.
    *   **Edit this to:** Change how the camera works, the sleep threshold (currently 2 seconds), or the alarm sound.

---

## 📂 Ignore These (They just make the code run)

*   `node_modules/`: A massive folder of code written by others (React, Next.js, etc.) that our app uses. **Never edit this.**
*   `public/`: Stores images and static files.
*   `.next/`: The built version of the app. Auto-generated.
*   `package.json` & `package-lock.json`: Keeps track of installed libraries.
*   `tsconfig.json`: Settings for TypeScript.
*   `next.config.ts` & `postcss.config.mjs`: Settings for Next.js and styling.
